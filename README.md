## About
Matter Megadrive is the continuation of the 1.7.10 version of [Matter Overdrive](https://github.com/simeonradivoev/MatterOverdrive).
Matter Megadrive is a Minecraft mod inspired by the popular Sci-fi TV series Star Trek. It dwells in the concept of replicating and transforming one type matter into another.
Although it may seem overpowered, Matter Megadrive takes a more realistic approach and requires the player to build a complex system before even the simplest replication can be achieved.

## Features
* **Matter Scanner**, for scanning matter patterns for replication.
* **Replicator**, for transforming matter into materials.
* **Decomposer**, for braking down materials into matter.
* **Transporter**, for beaming up.
* **Phaser**, to set on stun.
* **Fusion Reactor** and **Gravitational Anomalies**
* **Complex Networking** for replication control.
* **Star Map**, with Galaxies, Stars and Planets
* **Androids**, become an Android and learn powerful RPG like abilities, such as Teleportation and Forefield Shields.
